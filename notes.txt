JQuery Knob, 0-100 Value, 1 Value per sec + 1 Value per manual click, when it reaches 100 you get gems, 90% of lowest
value gem, 70% second lowest value, 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.1%. Equal amounts of gems as there are buildings.
The gems can be sacrificed to increase the chance of getting more of that gem. At first you only get 1 gem at a time, then
by sacrificing for example 10 of that gem, the next time you will recieve 2 gems, then it might cost 50 gems for the next upgrade and you'll get 4 
gems at a time.

Idea: Each gem also has a set value, which can be sold for a third currency, that you can sacrifice to speed up the rate at which the knob fills up.

Upgrades are when you sacrifice gems corresponding with that building to boost it's effectiveness, which gradually becomes more expensive.



Managers --
Managers are bought to keep the buildings running manually.
